### Theory

#### Lambda Execution Model
- Stateless execution environment
- Function invocation and lifecycle
- Concurrent executions and scaling

#### Runtimes
- Supported languages: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET, Ruby
- Custom runtimes using Lambda Layers

#### Triggers and Event Sources
- API Gateway
- S3 events
- DynamoDB Streams
- CloudWatch Events
- SNS, SQS, Kinesis
- Custom event sources

#### Configuration
- Environment variables
- Memory allocation and its impact on CPU
- Execution timeout
- IAM roles and permissions

#### Advanced Features
- Lambda Layers for code reuse
- Versions and aliases for deployment management
- VPC access for internal resource connectivity

#### Performance Considerations
- Cold starts: causes and mitigation strategies
- Provisioned Concurrency
- Execution context reuse

### Practice

1. Create Lambda functions using different runtimes:
   - Python function to process JSON data
   - Node.js function for string manipulation

2. Experiment with various triggers:
   - Set up an API Gateway trigger
   - Configure an S3 event trigger
   - Create a scheduled event using CloudWatch Events

3. Implement error handling and logging:
   - Use try-catch blocks for error handling
   - Utilize CloudWatch Logs for logging
   - Set up custom metrics using CloudWatch

### Mini Project: Serverless Image Processing Pipeline

Build a system that allows users to upload images to an S3 bucket, triggering a Lambda function that applies transformations and stores the processed images.

#### Steps:

1. Set up an S3 bucket for image uploads
2. Create a Lambda function with Python and Pillow library
3. Configure S3 event trigger for the Lambda function
4. Implement image processing logic:
   - Resize images to a standard size
   - Add a watermark
   - Convert images to a specific format (e.g., JPEG)
5. Store processed images in a separate S3 bucket
6. Implement error handling and logging
7. (Optional) Set up an API Gateway to allow programmatic uploads

#### Sample Python Code Snippet:

```python
import boto3
import os
from PIL import Image

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the source S3 bucket and object key
    source_bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Download the image from S3
    download_path = '/tmp/{}'.format(key)
    s3_client.download_file(source_bucket, key, download_path)
    
    # Process the image
    with Image.open(download_path) as image:
        # Resize
        image.thumbnail((200, 200))
        
        # Add watermark (simplified)
        image.paste('Watermark', (0, 0), Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 128)))
        
        # Save as JPEG
        processed_path = '/tmp/processed-{}.jpg'.format(os.path.splitext(key)[0])
        image.save(processed_path, 'JPEG')
    
    # Upload processed image
    destination_bucket = os.environ['DESTINATION_BUCKET']
    s3_client.upload_file(processed_path, destination_bucket, os.path.basename(processed_path))
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Image processed successfully'
    }

    Research: Lambda Performance Optimization

Minimizing package size:

Use Lambda Layers for large dependencies
Remove unnecessary files and libraries
Compress assets when possible


Optimizing cold starts:

Choose appropriate runtime (interpreted languages often start faster)
Minimize initialization code
Use Provisioned Concurrency for latency-sensitive applications


Using Provisioned Concurrency:

Configure and test different concurrency levels
Analyze cost implications
Implement auto-scaling for Provisioned Concurrency


Code optimization:

Efficient algorithms and data structures
Asynchronous programming patterns
Caching frequently used data


Monitoring and profiling:

Use AWS X-Ray for tracing
Analyze CloudWatch Logs and Metrics
Implement custom metrics for application-specific performance indicators
