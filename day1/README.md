### Contents

1. [Theory](#theory)
2. [Practice](#practice)
3. [Mini Project](#mini-project)
4. [Research](#research)

### Theory

In this section, we'll explore:
- The concept of serverless computing
- Comparison between serverless and traditional architectures
- Key benefits of serverless
- Potential drawbacks and considerations

### Practice

Get hands-on with AWS:
1. Set up your AWS account (if you haven't already)
2. Install and configure the AWS CLI
3. Navigate the AWS Management Console
4. Understand key AWS concepts:

### Mini Project

Deploy a "Hello World" Lambda function with a twist:
- Create a Lambda function that retrieves data from an external API
- Use a weather API to fetch and display current weather information
- Trigger the function and observe the dynamic results

### Research

Deepen your understanding:
- Explore serverless architecture patterns:
  - Microservices
  - Event-driven architectures
- Find and analyze real-world serverless adoption case studies across different industries
